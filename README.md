# Welcome to the OpenXLA Community

## This Repository 

OpenXLA is a community-driven, open source ML compiler ecosystem, using the best of XLA, MLIR, and IREE. The community repository stores documents used by the OpenXLA developer community:

* **[Governance](https://github.com/openxla/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md)** - Operating processes for OpenXLA
* **[Community Meetings](https://github.com/openxla/community/tree/main/meetings)** - Schedule, agenda & minutes for public OpenXLA community meetings
* **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/openxla/community/discussions)** - Announcements & technical and community conversations about the OpenXLA project & its components.

## Repositories

* [StableHLO](https://github.com/openxla/stablehlo): Portability layer between ML frameworks and ML compilers.
* [XLA](https://github.com/openxla/xla): Main XLA codebase (being migrated from tensorflow/compiler/xla).
* [IREE](https://github.com/iree-org/iree): MLIR-based end-to-end compiler and runtime for ML models (being migrated from [iree-org](https://github.com/iree-org)). Note that IREE has its own comms channels (see its README).

## Code of Conduct
Until an OpenXLA-specific Code of Conduct is in place, all community spaces for OpenXLA are subject to the [TensorFlow Code of Conduct](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
