# OpenXLA Interim Steering Committee

The OpenXLA Interim Steering Committee (OISC) is a group of Google maintainers of OpenXLA (with representatives from IREE, StableHLO, and XLA) responsible for bootstrapping [OpenXLA project governance](https://github.com/openxla/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md). Once the OISC's initial scope of work has been accomplished, and long-term governance bodies are established, this group will disband. 

## Charter

Quickly and transparently establish initial governance documentation, process & membership for OpenXLA. Delegate further evolution of project governance to the (to be created) OpenXLA Core Maintainers group. 

**In scope:**

* Establish initial community resources and processes, including RFCs, communication channels, Code of Conduct, GitHub org policy.
* Establish initial criteria/requirements for membership in OpenXLA & maintainer groups. 
* Bootstrap Core Maintainers and Module Maintainers groups, including initial charter & membership. 
* Identify/recommend other needed governance bodies (eg for GitHub Org management & policy).
* Handle any project escalations before Core Maintainers groups are established. 

**Out of scope:**

* Creating contributor guidelines for individual modules/projects
* Approving RFCs for individual modules/projects
* Setting repo-level policy 

## How we work 

The Interim Steering Committee meets regularly, and makes consensus-based decisions per [OpenXLA project governance](https://github.com/openxla/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).  Work is tracked in PRs and Issues on the [openxla/community](https://github.com/openxla/community/tree/main/meetings) repo, and the OISC invites your feedback there.

## Committee Members

Committee members are Googlers who contribute to and maintain OpenXLA project repos.
